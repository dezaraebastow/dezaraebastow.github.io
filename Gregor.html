      <p>The Underland Chronicles is a critically acclaimed series of five epic fantasy novels by Suzanne Collins, first published between 2003 and 2007. It tells the story of a boy named Gregor and his adventures in "Underland"; a hidden land under New York City. The Underland is inhabited by humans, who live in the stone city of Regalia, along with various giant versions of such creatures as bats, snails, moles, scorpions, cockroaches, rats, lizards, mice, ants, snakes, fireflies, and spiders which they call fliers, slimers, diggers, stingers, crawlers, gnawers, hissers, nibblers, cutters, twisters, shiners, and spinners, respectively. According to the author, the series involves many topics relating to war, including biological warfare, genocide, and military intelligence.</p>

        <p>In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games," a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when Prim is forced to represent her district in the Games, Katniss volunteers in her younger sisters place. The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. In the Arena many tributes fight for survival until only one of the 24 tributes remains, and will be crowned Victor of the Games. But will Katniss and other tributes survive, or will they find death waiting for them in the Arena?</p></div>

        <p>Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create. 
Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.</p></div>

        <p>Mockingjay begins in the midst of a war, a revolution led against President Snow and the Capitol by rebels who have taken refuge in the previously believed destroyed District 13. Katniss agrees to be the Mockingjay, the face of the rebellion, to rally those fighting for the cause, but fulfilling this role becomes increasingly difficult as the Capitol uses Peeta against her. While there is no official Hunger Games in this novel, Katniss recognizes that she is fighting in just that. The rules in these Games, however, are different because more than one person can survive, and Snow is a player as well. Katniss’ ultimate goals are to kill Snow and save Peeta; these are the thoughts that drive her forward during her grueling transformation into the Mockingjay.</p></div>
